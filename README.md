## Brief

### Requirements

The minimum viable product(MVP) was to create an application that uses CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions and using tools and methodologies learned during training so far.
* Using a kanban style board tech such as trello board that has user stories use cases and tasks needed to complete the project, including a detailed risk assesment.
* A relational database with at least 2 tables and one relation to store data for the project.
* A function CRUD application using python and flask while following best practices and designs.
* A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask
* Fully designed test suites for the application, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. Providing high test coverage in the backend and provide consistent reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.

### my approach
To fulfill these requirements i decided to make an aplication made for everyone, from gym sharks, to people who just want to lose weight which allows them to:

* Create a routine that stores:
  * A title for their routine.
  * Author.
  * Description.
* Create an exercise taht stores:
  * the exercise name.
  * the type of resistance such as Kilos and reesistance level.
  * store how long/many they shoudl do.
* View and update both routines and exercises. 
* delete exercises indervidually or all in one got when the perant routine is delted. 



### Stretch goal
* Implement log ins and accounts so only the person who created them can delete.
* Allow comments for other users to comment on routines that have been posted.
* split cardio and strength into their seportate tables.

## Architecture


### Database
This is the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). this is the current structure of the data base for teh the current build of teh application, it is a one to many relation shipe and stores all required information.
